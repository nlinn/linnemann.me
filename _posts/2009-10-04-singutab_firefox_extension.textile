I was searching for a firefox extension that closes old tabs matching a specific URL, when a new tab with that URL is opened – ended up scripting it on my own.

I have a swing application that delegates some workflows to a web project. It jumps to a number of URLs in that web project, opening them in the default web browser.

{% highlight java %}
// Java 6
java.awt.Desktop.getDesktop().browse(new URI("http://www.your.url"));
{% endhighlight %}

The browser (firefox in my case) opens a new window/tab, everytime this method is called – so if you use it excessively, you have to close all these tabs by hand, otherwise you end up with a lot of useless zombie-tabs.

One solution might be to close the tab automatically on the success page of a web flow. But what i was looking for is a firefox extension, that closes old tabs of this specific website everytime a new tab (containing this website) is openend – feels like “open url in same tab”, but that’s not exactly what it’s doing.

I’m not that interested in firefox extensions, javascript, XUL and all that stuff, so i “compiled” a working extension from tutorials and code snippets.

By now, you have to configure your URL pattern in the extensions source, but its peace of cake:

# singutab.xpi is a zip archive, open that archive with your favorite unzipper
# go to the folder chrome/content and open singutab.js
# edit the first line: var myPattern = ‘google’; – replace google with anything that makes sense to you.

Download: singutab.xpi (just drag the file into your firefox window to install)

The default pattern is google, so with singutab installed you will only have one tab showing a google website at the same time.
